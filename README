This is a shell script to turn on/off an IPv6 tunnel using the tun6to4
interface, which exchanges IPv6 packets by encapsulating them in IPv4
packets and using protocol 41 to the IPv4 anycast address 192.88.99.1

Instructions for doing this typically discuss laborious manual
configuration, tedious calculations, manipulation of various
networking configuration files, and modifications when the host moves
to a different IP address.  Meaning basically no one does it.

This script instead sets up the tunnel completely automatically,
without monkeying with any networking configuration files.

See the top of the script for instructions, or invoke with no
arguments for usage summary.

CAUTION!

Unless instructed otherwise via -r, if radvd is installed this script
will turn on routing/adverting of an IPv6 subnet on the local network.
This will enable IPv6 automatically on other machines on the local
network.  If IPv6 isn't working as well as IPv4, that can cause
mysterious performance problems when those machines try to talk to
remote hosts which have both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS records.

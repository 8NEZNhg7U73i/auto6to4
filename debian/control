Description: Enable IPv6 via IPv4 protocol 41 tunnel
 Script to turn on/off an IPv6 tunnel using the tun6to4 interface,
 which exchanges IPv6 packets by encapsulating them in IPv4 packets
 and using protocol 41 to the IPv4 anycast address 192.88.99.1
 .
 Instructions for doing this typically discuss laborious manual
 configuration, tedious calculations, manipulation of various
 networking configuration files, all of which must be redone when the
 host moves to a different IP address.  This script instead sets up
 the 6to4 tunnel completely automatically, without modification to any
 networking configuration files or other configuration.  It is robust:
 for example, if the local host does not have a first-class IPv4
 address it exits with a cogent warning.
 .
 If radvd is installed, when possible a subnet is routed and
 advertised.
